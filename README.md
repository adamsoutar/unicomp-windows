# British macOS Unicomp Space-Saver layout for Windows

I have possibly faced a near-unique challenge. But just in-case it isn't and somebody else out there is as mental as I am, here, I saved you the trouble.

This repo contains a mapping for the Unicomp Space Saver M (for macOS) British Layout board for use with Windows 11.

The British macOS layout is not the same as the standard US one, for example it has a `£` symbol on Shift+3. This map also contains the edge-cases such as AltGr+3 for `#`, and correctly mapped `§±~` keys. 

This is essential if you:

 - Program with your Model M keyboard
 - Are British
 - Mostly use a Mac but
 - Sometimes have to use Windows
 - Don't want to swap boards when swapping machines

If all of the above has happened to you, you're welcome!

## Mac text cursor

I recommend using this layout in combination with the following [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) key remap:

which gives you Cmd+Left/Right and Cmd+Up/Down for moving the cursor while programming.
